			<h3> Kaisermann's Personal Website</h3>

			<p class="content">One website that I found particularly interesting was Christian Kaisermann's personal website. He has used an interesting style for his page, with the initial look upon loading the site being reminiscent of old CRT tv's. I liked the fact that it presented itself in an interesting and unexpected manner, with effects on the mouse, other effects when hovering over things, </p>

			<h3> Dpt. </h3>

			<p>The Dpt. site was rather interesting in just how interactive the website was and how fluid interacting with it felt. </p>
