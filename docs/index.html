			<p>This site is simply going to be a blog looking at various different sites that have interesting layouts or designs and what drew me to them.</p>

			<h3> Kaisermann's Personal Website</h3>
			</a>

			<p class="content">One website that I found particularly interesting was Christian Kaisermann's personal website. He has used an interesting style for his page, with the initial look upon loading the site being reminiscent of old CRT tv's. I liked the fact that it presented itself in an interesting and unexpected manner, with effects on the mouse, other effects when hovering over things, </p>

		<div id="Dpt.">
			<a class=site-title href="https://dpt.co/en">
			<h3> Dpt. </h3>
			</a>
			<img src="/WebDevSites/src/images/Dpt. 1.png" class=image_center alt="Dpt. first look" height="692" width="687">
			<p class=content>The Dpt. site was rather interesting in just how interactive the website was and how fluid interacting with it felt. The site creators have created a site that both has a layout with specific sections of the page for buttons and other things that can be interacted with, but they have done it in a way in which it is unobtrusive and it gives a seamless feel to the pages.

			<a class=site-title href="https://neal.fun/deep-sea/">
			<h3>The Deep Sea</h3>
			</a>
			<img src="/WebDevSites/src/images/Deep Sea.png" class=image_center alt="Deep Sea Screenshot" width="815" height="378">
			<p class=content>So, if I'm being honest there isn't a particular thing that stands out about this site, other then perhaps it's simplicity. It is a page that's only purpose is to demonstrate what life is in the ocean, and it has the occasional comment on facts relevant at the different depths reached. However it isn't as simple as it appears to be on the surface, with the background gradually scrolling with different colors based on how much light there is at each depth, and a subtle effect changing how the background looks and makes thing move enough that it seems like there are things floating in the back.
